# Fantasy Cricket Team Simulation Project

## 🏏 Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated Python-based solution to simulate approximately 20,000 unique fantasy cricket teams using player selection probabilities.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Data Schema**

#### Input Data (player_data_sample.csv)
- **22 players** with roles: Batsman (8), Allrounder (6), Bowler (6), WK (2)
- **Key columns**: player_code, player_name, role, team, perc_selection
- **Selection probabilities**: Range from 0.0283 to 0.9522

#### Output Data (team_df.csv)
- **Format**: match_code, player_code, player_name, role, team, perc_selection, team_id
- **Scale**: 106,546 rows (9,686 teams × 11 players)
- **Validation**: All teams satisfy role constraints

### **Algorithm Approaches**

#### 1. **Basic Probability-Based Selection** (`final_simulation.py`)
- Weighted random selection using perc_selection values
- Role constraint enforcement
- Team uniqueness validation

#### 2. **Target-Tracking Algorithm** (`improved_simulation.py`)

### **Core Algorithm Logic**

```python
# Simplified algorithm flow
def generate_team():
    1. Calculate selection priorities based on target deficits
    2. Select one player from each required role using weighted probabilities
    3. Fill remaining 7 spots from all available players
    4. Validate team composition and uniqueness
    5. Update player selection counts
    6. Return valid team or retry

## 🔬 Algorithm Challenges & Solutions

### **Mathematical Complexity**
The core challenge involves solving a **constrained optimization problem** with multiple competing objectives:

1. **Probability Matching**: Each player's selection frequency must match their `perc_selection` value
2. **Role Constraints**: Every team needs ≥1 player from each of 4 roles
3. **Team Uniqueness**: No duplicate team compositions among 20,000 teams
4. **Limited Player Pool**: Only 22 players available for selection

### **Technical Solutions Implemented**

#### **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**
```python
# Adjust selection probability based on current deficit
deficit = target_selections - current_selections
remaining_teams = total_target - teams_generated
adjusted_probability = deficit / remaining_teams
```

#### **Multi-Template Generation**
- **Template 1**: Balanced (3 Batsman, 3 Bowler, 1 WK, 4 Allrounder)
- **Template 2**: Batsman-heavy (4 Batsman, 3 Bowler, 1 WK, 3 Allrounder)
- **Template 3**: Bowler-heavy (3 Batsman, 4 Bowler, 1 WK, 3 Allrounder)
- **Template 4**: Allrounder-heavy (2 Batsman, 2 Bowler, 2 WK, 5 Allrounder)

#### **Batch Processing**
- Process teams in batches of 1,000 for memory efficiency
- Real-time accuracy monitoring every 5 batches
- Progressive algorithm refinement based on intermediate results
